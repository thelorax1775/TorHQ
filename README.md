# TorHQ

TorHQ is a self-hosted **control plane** for a Proxmox media homelab. It gives you
one authenticated web UI in front of the services you already run — Radarr,
Sonarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent, slskd, Jellyfin, Navidrome, and Kavita —
plus a small, deliberately-scoped **manual intake** pipeline for content those
tools don't manage (loose books, manga, and Soulseek music).

It also closes the acquisition loop: **search** (via Prowlarr's indexers, a
scraped torrent-index site, or a general web widget), **grab** the release you
chose, **watch** it download in qBittorrent, and **verify** that the right \*arr
adopted and imported it — all from one page set, without tab-hopping between five
web UIs.

TorHQ is built to sit quietly next to your existing stack. It **observes and
requests**, and performs only explicit, user-initiated grabs — it does not take
over your \*arr apps' pipelines.

> **The core boundary.** TorHQ **never moves, renames, or reorganizes media owned
> by the \*arr applications.** Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr own search, grab, import,
> rename, and final placement of everything they manage. TorHQ only performs its
> own explicit, previewed, approved **manual-intake** action, and every filesystem
> operation is confined to the directories listed in `TORHQ_APPROVED_ROOTS`.

## What TorHQ does

| Area | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Aggregated service health, qBittorrent downloads grouped by category, \*arr activity (history + wanted/missing), slskd downloads, storage usage, and failed-import surfacing. |
| **Requests** | Search Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr, **choose the intended result**, and submit an add+search request. TorHQ asks; the \*arr does the work. |
| **Search** | Three sources behind one page: **Prowlarr** (aggregated across every indexer), a scraped **torrent-index site**, and a general **web widget**. Grab a chosen release into a neutral `torhq-manual` category, or hand it to `radarr`/`sonarr`/`lidarr` so that \*arr adopts and imports it. |
| **Downloads** | Full qBittorrent control — pause/resume/recheck, priority, category moves, and both flavours of removal, with the destructive one gated behind a typed confirmation. |
| **Queue** | The Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr queues merged into one view, with the \*arr's own error messages surfaced, plus per-item removal and blocklisting. One dead service degrades to a notice; it never blanks the view. |
| **Pipeline health** | Read-only checks of the grab → download → import path: does the \*arr have a download client, do its categories match, can it actually see the directory qBittorrent writes to. Each failing check names the fix — TorHQ never applies one silently. |
| **Manual intake** | Preview and then atomically import a completed file/folder into a **Kavita** (books/manga/comics) or **Navidrome** (music) library, then trigger a rescan. Per library, either moves the source in or **hardlinks** it so a seeding torrent is left intact. Durable, idempotent, retried. |
| **slskd webhook** | Completed Soulseek downloads are pushed to `/webhooks/slskd` (shared-token auth) and enqueued as intake jobs into a music library. |
| **Services** | Encrypted-at-rest credential storage with a connection tester. Secrets are never returned to the browser. |

---

## Architecture

TorHQ is a TypeScript monorepo (npm workspaces, Node 20+).

- **Backend** — Fastify 4 with `@fastify/cookie`, `@fastify/rate-limit`, and
  `@fastify/static`. Data lives in SQLite via `better-sqlite3` with a Drizzle
  schema. Service credentials are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). A single
  in-process worker drains a durable, SQLite-backed job queue.
- **Frontend** — React 18 + Vite single-page app. In production the server serves
  the built assets from `web/dist` on the same origin (no CORS), so the session
  cookie and CSRF token cover the whole app.
- **Adapters** — one small typed HTTP client per service, all implementing a
  common `ServiceAdapter` health contract, constructed on demand from the
  decrypted, per-service config.
- **Portability** — the schema avoids SQLite-only tricks (epoch-ms integer
  timestamps, JSON stored as text) so it can move to Postgres later.

### Data model

| Table | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `users` | Single admin account (scrypt password hash). |
| `sessions` | Server-side sessions with a per-session CSRF token. |
| `services` | One row per configured service; secret **encrypted**, adapter config as JSON. |
| `libraries` | Manual-intake destinations (Kavita/Navidrome) with dest + staging paths. |
| `jobs` | Durable intake queue: status, attempts, backoff, idempotency key. |
| `activity` | Append-only audit/activity timeline for jobs and requests. |
| `schema_migrations` | Applied forward-only migration versions. |

## The intake boundary (TorHQ vs. the \*arr)

This is the most important thing to understand about TorHQ.

**\*arr-owned media (movies, TV, \*arr-managed music).**
Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr fully own their download → import → rename → placement
pipeline. TorHQ's role is limited to **requesting** an add+search through their
APIs. TorHQ never reads, moves, renames, or deletes files that an \*arr manages,
and it never writes into an \*arr root folder. Doing so would corrupt the \*arr's
own bookkeeping and hard-linking.

**TorHQ-owned intake (loose books, manga, comics, Soulseek music).**
Some content has no \*arr. For those, TorHQ offers a manual-intake pipeline that
is explicit and previewed end-to-end:

1. You (or the slskd webhook) name a **source path** inside an approved root.
2. TorHQ builds a **dry-run preview**: it validates containment, rejects symlink
   escapes, and lists exactly what will be imported.
3. On approval, a durable job **atomically imports** the content into the
   library's destination via a same-filesystem staging directory, then requests a
   **rescan** of the target service (Kavita or Navidrome).

Each library chooses **how** step 3 gets the bytes across:

| Import mode | What happens | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Move** (default) | Copies the source into staging, reveals it atomically, then **deletes the source**. | The source is a scratch drop directory you want emptied. |
| **Hardlink** | Gives the files a second name inside the library. No bytes are read or written, no extra disk space is used, and **the source is left exactly as it was**. | The source is a torrent that is still seeding, or anything else you are not willing to lose. |

Hardlink mode is the same trick the \*arr use to import a completed download
without disturbing the torrent behind it. It requires the source and the library
to be on **one filesystem** — if they are not, the import fails with an
explanation rather than silently falling back to a copy-and-delete that would
break the seed.

Manual-intake destinations may only target **Kavita** or **Navidrome**. Jellyfin
(movies/TV) is intentionally *not* an intake target — that content is \*arr-owned.
TorHQ integrates with Jellyfin for health/status only.

Every path is checked with defense-in-depth containment (lexical `..` collapse,
prefix-aliasing-safe root check, and `realpath` symlink-escape rejection) against
`TORHQ_APPROVED_ROOTS`. There are no destructive media operations beyond this one
previewed, approved import.

## Search, grab, and the import loop

This section explains the mechanism — what the sources are, how a grab is routed,
and why an import stalls. For a click-by-click tour of the pages themselves, see
[Using TorHQ](#using-torhq).

The **Search** page has three sources. They answer different questions, so the
page shows all three and lets you pick:

| Source | What it is | Grabbable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prowlarr** | An aggregated search across every indexer Prowlarr manages. The robust option, and the default. | Yes |
| **Torrent site** | A directly-scraped torrent-index mirror. Configuration-driven, and fragile by nature — see below. | Yes |
| **Web** | A general web search widget, for finding out *what* to look for rather than fetching it. Can embed Google's own Programmable Search widget, which needs an engine id and nothing else. | No — it links out |

A source that can't be used right now is still listed, disabled, with the reason
next to it. A missing Prowlarr, a Cloudflare-blocked mirror and a mis-typed API
key produce three different messages, not one generic failure.

### Grabbing

Choose a **target** when you grab, and the target decides what happens:

- **Radarr / Sonarr / Lidarr** — Prowlarr hands the release to its download
  client, and TorHQ immediately asks that \*arr to poll its download client
  (`RefreshMonitoredDownloads`) so it adopts and imports the download without
  waiting. The \*arr still owns the import, rename and placement.
- **qBittorrent (`torhq-manual`)** — a raw download that TorHQ owns and no \*arr
  will touch. You organize it yourself.

Only well-formed `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:<hash>` links are accepted for site grabs;
Prowlarr grabs travel by `guid` + `indexerId`, and the proxy download URL is
re-signed and origin-checked server-side before it ever reaches qBittorrent. The
grab category is restricted to a fixed allowlist.

### Why an import fails, and how to find out

Grabbing into an \*arr's category only results in an import if the whole path
lines up: the item must be added and monitored in that \*arr, qBittorrent must be
its download client with the matching category, Completed Download Handling must
be on, and — the one that catches everyone — **the \*arr container must actually
be able to see the directory qBittorrent writes to.** A download client on a
different host, or an LXC without the right bind mount, produces a silent
never-imports loop with no error anywhere.

The **Queue** page runs those checks explicitly (`GET /api/pipeline/check`) and
names the fix for each failing one. It also lists downloads that finished but
could not be imported, and can ask the owning \*arr to scan one again. TorHQ
never repairs a mismatch itself and never moves a file to work around one.

> **Tip:** if downloads and libraries sit on the same filesystem, bind-mount the
> download directory into each \*arr at the *same path qBittorrent uses*. Imports
> then hardlink — instant, and no second copy of the data.

### Configuring a mirror (and why it's fragile)

Public torrent-index mirrors rot constantly — domains change, markup drifts, and
many sit behind Cloudflare. So the scraper is **fully configuration-driven**: the
`torrentsearch` service's *extra* config holds the search-path template and a CSS
selector for each field (row, title, magnet, seeders, leechers, size, detail
link), plus a `magnetOnDetailPage` toggle. Blank fields fall back to built-in
KickassTorrents-style defaults. When a mirror changes, **re-point the base URL or
adjust a selector — no code change needed**.

If a mirror is behind a Cloudflare browser challenge, a plain server-side fetch
gets blocked; TorHQ surfaces a clear error rather than failing silently. Set an
optional **Cloudflare solver URL** in the same config to route fetches through a
challenge solver.

Any service speaking FlareSolverr's `/v1` API works, but the choice matters:

- **[Byparr](https://github.com/ThePhaseless/Byparr)** — use this. It drives a
  real browser and clears the challenges that currently stop everything else.
- **[FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr)** — the original,
  and the reason the config key is still `flaresolverrUrl`. It no longer clears
  current Cloudflare challenges: it detects them and then times out, on every
  attempt, regardless of browser version or headless setting.

Because a browser-driving solver is slow to start, the solver timeout defaults
to **120 s** (`solverTimeoutMs`, 10–300 s). TorHQ's own socket timeout sits above
the solver's deadline on purpose, so a failed solve returns the solver's own
explanation instead of an aborted connection.

### The web widget

The web source never scrapes google.com. It supports four providers:

- **`link`** (default, zero-config) — builds ready-made link-outs to the search
  engines you'd have opened in another tab anyway. Works with no credentials.
- **`widget`** — Google's own [Programmable Search
  Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/) embed, rendered on the
  page. **Needs only the engine id (`cx`)** — no API key, no daily quota. This
  is the least-setup way to get real Google results inside TorHQ.
- **`google`** — the Programmable Search **JSON API**, using the same `cx` plus
  an API key. Results are rendered by TorHQ in the app's own styling, but the
  free tier stops at 100 queries a day.
- **`searxng`** — your own SearXNG instance.

A provider that fails degrades to `link` and says so, rather than returning
nothing.

**What the widget costs you.** It is the one part of TorHQ that loads
third-party code: the browser fetches `cse.js` from Google and queries Google
directly, so the search terms and the viewer's IP go to Google without passing
through the server. That is unavoidable for an embed, and it is what removes the
API key and the quota. If you would rather nothing left your network unproxied,
use `searxng`; if you would rather TorHQ do the talking, use `google`.

TorHQ mounts the widget in its *results-only* layout, so the page keeps its own
search box and feeds the term in. The widget renders in Google's own light
styling — it will not follow TorHQ's dark theme, because restyling markup from
another origin reliably produces unreadable results rather than a matching one.

## Local development

Requires **Node 20+** (22 works). `better-sqlite3` is a native module, so a C
toolchain is needed on first install (`build-essential python3` on Debian).

```bash
git clone <repo> torhq && cd torhq
npm install            # installs both workspaces from the committed lockfile

# Minimal dev environment (loopback, an approved root you can write to):
export TORHQ_MASTER_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
export TORHQ_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.dev/data"
export TORHQ_APPROVED_ROOTS="$PWD/.dev"
export NODE_ENV=development
mkdir -p "$PWD/.dev"

# Terminal 1 — API on :8787 (tsx watch)
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server on :5173, proxying /api and /webhooks to :8787
npm run dev:web
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> and create the admin account.

### Useful scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Server with hot reload (`tsx watch`). |
| `npm run dev:web` | Vite dev server for the SPA. |
| `npm test` | Vitest (crypto, path safety, auth/routing, intake, migrations). |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` for both workspaces. |
| `npm run build` | Compile server (`tsc`) and build the SPA (`vite build`). |
| `npm start` | Run the compiled server (`node server/dist/index.js`). |
| `npm run migrate` | Apply database migrations standalone. |

---

## Environment variables

Only **infrastructure** config lives in the environment. Per-service API keys and
passwords are entered in the setup wizard and stored **encrypted** in the
database — never in env, never in git. See [`.env.example`](.env.example).

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | `development` \| `test` \| `production`. |
| `TORHQ_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Keep on loopback; expose via a reverse proxy. |
| `TORHQ_PORT` | `8787` | Bind port. |
| `TORHQ_DATA_DIR` | `/srv/torhq/data` | Writable dir holding `torhq.db`. |
| `TORHQ_MASTER_KEY` | *(required)* | 16+ char key used to derive the AES-256-GCM key that encrypts stored secrets. **Generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`.** Changing it after services are saved makes existing secrets unrecoverable. |
| `TORHQ_APPROVED_ROOTS` | `/srv/torhq` | Colon-separated base dirs. **Every** filesystem operation must stay inside one of these. Keep as tight as possible. |
| `TORHQ_TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Trust `X-Forwarded-*` (enable **only** behind a trusted reverse proxy). |
| `TORHQ_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Mark the session cookie `Secure` (enable when served over HTTPS). |
| `TORHQ_METRICS_ENABLED` | `false` | Expose Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`. |
| `TORHQ_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `fatal` \| `error` \| `warn` \| `info` \| `debug` \| `trace`. |

---

## First-run setup

Steps 1–3 get you a working UI. **Steps 4–6 are what make imports actually
happen** — a stack that skips them looks perfectly configured and silently never
imports anything. The Queue page's pipeline checks verify all of it, so if you
would rather not read ahead: do steps 1–3, open **Queue**, and fix whatever it
tells you.

1. **Create the admin account.** The first visit shows a one-time registration
   screen (`POST /api/auth/register`). Once an admin exists, registration is
   permanently disabled and the screen becomes a login form.

2. **Add your services.** On the **Services** page, enter each service's base URL
   and secret, use **Test connection**, then save. Secret formats:
   - Radarr / Sonarr / Lidarr / Prowlarr — API key
   - qBittorrent — `username:password`
   - slskd — API key (set a **webhook token** in its extra config to enable the intake webhook)
   - Jellyfin — API token
   - Navidrome — `username:password`
   - Kavita — API key (optionally set a **library ID** to trigger explicit scans)
   - torrentsearch — no secret; set the base URL to a torrent-index mirror and,
     if needed, override the site-profile selectors / add a Cloudflare solver URL
     (Byparr — see [the torrent site source](#configuring-a-mirror-and-why-its-fragile))
   - websearch — no secret for the default link-out provider. For real Google
     results the cheapest setup is provider `widget` with just a `cx` from
     programmablesearchengine.google.com; provider `google` additionally needs an
     API key and is capped at 100 queries a day; or point `searxngUrl` at your
     own SearXNG

   Secrets are write-only: TorHQ shows *configured* / *not set* and never returns
   the value. Leaving a secret field blank when editing keeps the stored one.

3. **Define intake libraries** (only if you use manual intake). On the
   **Libraries** page, create Kavita/Navidrome destinations. Both the destination
   and staging paths must live inside an approved root and, for atomic imports,
   on the same filesystem. Pick an **import mode** per library: *Move* deletes
   the source once the import succeeds; *Hardlink* imports in place and leaves it
   alone, which is what you want when importing off a seeding torrent.

4. **Create qBittorrent categories.** One per *arr, plus one you own:
   `radarr`, `sonarr`, `lidarr`, `torhq-manual`. The category is how a finished
   download is attributed to the app that should import it.

5. **Wire qBittorrent into each \*arr.** In Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr →
   *Settings → Download Clients*, add qBittorrent, **set its category to the
   matching name from step 4**, and make sure *Completed Download Handling* is
   on. In Prowlarr → *Settings → Apps*, add each \*arr so indexers sync to them,
   and add qBittorrent under *Settings → Download Clients*.

6. **Make the download directory visible to each \*arr.** This is the step
   that catches everyone. Each \*arr must be able to reach qBittorrent's save
   path **at the same path string qBittorrent reports**, or it will be handed a
   directory that does not exist in its filesystem and will never import.

   On Proxmox LXC, bind-mount it into every \*arr container:

   ```bash
   # Replace 128 with each *arr's container id, and the paths with your own.
   pct set 128 -mp3 /mnt/pve/storage/torrents,mp=/mnt/torrents
   pct reboot 128
   ```

   Keep the container path identical to qBittorrent's and you need no remote path
   mapping — and because downloads and libraries then share a filesystem, imports
   **hardlink**: instant, and no second copy of the data.

   Docker users: mount the same host directory at the same path in every
   container, not `/downloads` in one and `/data/torrents` in another.

Then open **Queue** and confirm the pipeline checks are green. A scripted
walkthrough of every endpoint is in [`docs/curl-examples.md`](docs/curl-examples.md).

## Using TorHQ

The sidebar is grouped by what you are trying to do.

### Dashboard

The landing page, ordered by what actually goes wrong. Pipeline health leads —
those checks are what silently break imports — then current transfers and queue
depth, then service health, storage and failed intake jobs. Every card polls
independently, so one unreachable service degrades to a notice instead of
blanking the page.

### Acquire

**Search** — the main event. Pick a source, type a term, and every result row
ends in a grab.

- **Prowlarr** aggregates every indexer you run. This is the one to reach for.
  Narrow it with the indexer and category filters when a search is too broad.
- **Torrent site** is the scraper, useful when Prowlarr is down or unconfigured.
- **Web** is a link-out widget for working out *what* you want. It returns links,
  never grabbable releases.

Set **Send grabs to** before you grab — it decides what happens next:

| Target | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Radarr / Sonarr / Lidarr | The release goes to that \*arr's category and the \*arr is asked to poll immediately, so it adopts and imports without waiting. |
| qBittorrent (manual) | Lands in `torhq-manual`. Nothing imports it; it is yours to organize. |

The whole query — source, term, filters — lives in the URL, so a search is
reloadable and shareable. `seeders: —` means the indexer reported no count; it
does not mean zero.

An unavailable source is shown disabled with the reason rather than hidden, so
"Prowlarr: no enabled indexers" is visible instead of a silently missing tab.

How a grab is actually routed, and what is accepted, is in
[Search, grab, and the import loop](#search-grab-and-the-import-loop).

> Grabbing into an \*arr's category only imports if that title is **added and
> monitored** in the \*arr. Use **Requests** to add it first, or grab to
> `torhq-manual` and handle it yourself.

**Downloads** — everything in qBittorrent. Filter by state or category, select
rows for bulk pause/resume/recheck/priority/category moves. Two removals:
*Remove* takes the torrent out of the client and **leaves the files**;
*Remove + delete files* destroys the data and requires typing `DELETE`.

**Queue** — the \*arr side of those same downloads, and the page to open when
something did not import.

- **Pipeline health** — the checks from setup steps 4–6, re-run live. Each
  failing check names the fix. TorHQ never applies one for you.
- **Failed imports** — finished downloads the \*arr refused. *Retry import* asks
  the owning \*arr to scan it again; the \*arr still does the moving and renaming.
- **The queue itself** — expand a row for the \*arr's own error messages.
  Removing an item can optionally also drop the torrent and blocklist the release
  so it is not grabbed again. Files stay on disk either way.
- **Poll download clients** forces every \*arr to check qBittorrent now, instead
  of waiting for its own timer.

**Requests** — ask an \*arr to add something new. Pick the route, search that
\*arr's own lookup, choose the exact candidate (never "the first hit"), set the
profile and root folder, confirm. TorHQ's job ends at that POST; the \*arr owns
everything after.

### Library

**Intake** — manual staging for content the \*arr do not own: books, manga,
comics and music going to Kavita/Navidrome. **Preview is mandatory** — a dry run
validates both paths against the approved roots and shows exactly what would
move, and the Import button disables itself the moment the form stops matching
the preview, so a stale preview can never justify a different import. The preview
also states what will happen to the source — a library in *Move* mode raises an
explicit warning that the source is about to be deleted. This never touches a
Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr library.

**Libraries** — the Kavita/Navidrome destinations intake can target, each with
its **import mode** (*Move* or *Hardlink* — see
[the intake boundary](#the-intake-boundary-torhq-vs-the-arr)). Removing one
only makes TorHQ forget it; nothing on disk is deleted, and the removal is
refused while intake jobs are still queued against it.

**Jobs & activity** — TorHQ's own intake worker, not the \*arr. Filter by status,
expand a row for that job's history, retry a failed or dead one. The activity
feed below is the append-only audit log of every action TorHQ took.

### System

**Services** — connections and credentials, with a per-service *Test connection*
that reports the real reason for a failure (wrong port, 401, timeout) rather than
a generic error.

**Mounts** — read-only storage visibility: which network shares are bind-mounted
in, and free space on each approved root. TorHQ runs unprivileged and cannot
mount anything itself, so the "add a share" box generates the host-side command
for you to run — nothing on this page changes storage.

**Settings** — theme (system/dark/light) and background refresh rate, both stored
in this browser only, plus the approved roots this instance is allowed to touch.
Turning the refresh rate down is worth doing for an always-on wall display.

---

## Production deployment (LXC)

TorHQ is designed to run as an unprivileged systemd service inside a Debian 12
Proxmox LXC, behind an optional nginx TLS terminator.

### One-line install on a Proxmox VE host (auto-creates the LXC)

Run this **on the Proxmox VE host** (as root). It creates a fresh unprivileged
Debian 12 container, installs TorHQ inside it, and starts it — no manual
container setup:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelorax1775/TorHQ/main/scripts/proxmox-install.sh)"
```

When it finishes it prints the container IP; open `http://<container-ip>:8787` and
create the admin account.

**If the repository is private**, `raw.githubusercontent.com` can't serve the
script and the in-container `git clone` needs credentials. Use a GitHub token
(fine-grained PAT with **Contents → Read-only** on this repo) — export it so both
the download and the clone can authenticate:

```bash
export TORHQ_GIT_TOKEN=github_pat_xxxxxxxx
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TORHQ_GIT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" \

```

The exported `TORHQ_GIT_TOKEN` is inherited by the script and used for the clone;
it is passed to git via a request header, so it is never written to disk. (If you
make the repo public, the plain `curl … raw.githubusercontent.com …` one-liner
above works with no token.)

By default it shows an **interactive menu** (like the community-scripts
installers): confirm the defaults, or choose **Advanced** to pick the container
ID, resources, **storage location** (rootfs and template storage are listed from
your *enabled* Proxmox storages), network (DHCP or a static IP), and more.

For unattended runs, set the values via environment variables and
`TORHQ_NONINTERACTIVE=1` to skip the menu. Every setting has an override:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TORHQ_CTID` | next free id | LXC container ID. |
| `TORHQ_HOSTNAME` | `torhq` | Container hostname. |
| `TORHQ_DISK` | `8` | Root disk size (GB). |
| `TORHQ_RAM` | `2048` | RAM (MB). |
| `TORHQ_CORES` | `2` | vCPU count. |
| `TORHQ_STORAGE` | auto (first enabled `rootdir`; `local-lvm` if present) | Storage for the rootfs. |
| `TORHQ_TEMPLATE_STORAGE` | auto (first enabled `vztmpl`) | Storage the Debian template is downloaded to. |
| `TORHQ_NONINTERACTIVE` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` to skip the menu and use env/defaults only. |
| `TORHQ_BRIDGE` | `vmbr0` | Network bridge. |
| `TORHQ_NET` | `dhcp` | `dhcp` or a static CIDR (e.g. `192.168.1.50/24`). |
| `TORHQ_GW` | *(none)* | Gateway — **required** for a static `TORHQ_NET`. |
| `TORHQ_BIND` | `0.0.0.0` | Address TorHQ binds to inside the CT (LAN-reachable). |
| `TORHQ_BRANCH` | `main` | Git branch to install from. |

Example — a fixed IP and more resources:

```bash
TORHQ_NET=192.168.1.50/24 TORHQ_GW=192.168.1.1 TORHQ_RAM=4096 TORHQ_DISK=16 \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelorax1775/TorHQ/main/scripts/proxmox-install.sh)"
```

> The installer binds TorHQ to `0.0.0.0` so it's reachable on your LAN at the
> container IP. To expose it beyond the LAN, front it with the nginx TLS reverse
> proxy below and set `TORHQ_TRUST_PROXY`/`TORHQ_COOKIE_SECURE`.

> **Before PR #3 is merged**, install from the feature branch by also fetching the
> script from it:
> ```bash
> TORHQ_BRANCH=claude/arr-stack-integration-9jtos4 \
>   bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelorax1775/TorHQ/claude/arr-stack-integration-9jtos4/scripts/proxmox-install.sh)"
> ```

### Mounting NFS/SMB shares (NAS storage for downloads)

To store downloads on a NAS, mount the share **on the Proxmox host** and bind it
into the container that runs qBittorrent. This is the right pattern for
unprivileged LXCs, which can't mount network filesystems themselves.

The one-line installer above **offers to set up a share during provisioning**
(interactively, or unattended when the `TORHQ_SHARE_*` variables below are set —
`TORHQ_TARGET_CTID` defaults to the new container). You can also run the host
helper any time:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelorax1775/TorHQ/main/scripts/mount-share.sh)"
```

It prompts for the share type (NFS or SMB/CIFS), the remote path, SMB
credentials (stored root-only in `/etc/torhq-shares/<name>.cred`, never in
fstab), and an optional target container to bind into. It then:

1. Installs `nfs-common` / `cifs-utils` on the host as needed.
2. Mounts the share at `/mnt/torhq-shares/<name>` and persists it in `/etc/fstab`
   (survives reboot).
3. Adds a bind mount point to the target LXC (`pct set <ctid> -mpN …`) at the
   path you choose — then `pct reboot <ctid>` and point qBittorrent's save path
   (and its `radarr`/`sonarr` category paths) there.

Unattended example:

```bash
TORHQ_SHARE_TYPE=nfs TORHQ_SHARE_REMOTE=192.168.1.10:/volume1/media \
TORHQ_SHARE_NAME=media TORHQ_TARGET_CTID=105 TORHQ_CT_PATH=/mnt/media \
TORHQ_NONINTERACTIVE=1 \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelorax1775/TorHQ/main/scripts/mount-share.sh)"
```

> For unprivileged containers you may need to set the mount's `uid`/`gid` to your
> download user's *mapped* id (host id + 100000) via `TORHQ_SHARE_OPTS` so the
> service can write. TorHQ shows any NFS/SMB shares mounted into **its own**
> container on the dashboard (**Network mounts**), read-only — it never mounts
> anything itself.

To remove a share cleanly (host unmount + fstab entry + container bind mount +
SMB credentials), run the companion helper on the host:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelorax1775/TorHQ/main/scripts/unmount-share.sh)"
```

### Manual install (inside an existing LXC)

```bash
# Inside the LXC, as root:
git clone <repo> /opt/torhq-src && cd /opt/torhq-src
./scripts/install.sh
```

`scripts/install.sh` is idempotent and will:

1. Create the unprivileged `torhq` system user.
2. Install Node.js 20 (NodeSource) if missing.
3. Create the directory layout under `/srv/torhq` (`data`, `staging`,
   `downloads`, `libraries/{movies,tv,music,books,manga}`).
4. Copy the source to `/srv/torhq/app`, run `npm ci`, and build.
5. Generate `/etc/torhq/torhq.env` with a fresh `TORHQ_MASTER_KEY` (created once,
   never overwritten), locked to `0640 torhq:torhq`.
6. Install and start the `torhq` systemd unit.

Then open `http://<lxc-ip>:8787` and create the admin account.

```bash
systemctl status torhq
journalctl -u torhq -f
```

### Reverse proxy (HTTPS)

TorHQ binds to loopback. Terminate TLS with nginx
([`deploy/torhq.nginx.conf`](deploy/torhq.nginx.conf)) and set
`TORHQ_TRUST_PROXY=true` and `TORHQ_COOKIE_SECURE=true` in the env file.

### systemd hardening

[`deploy/torhq.service`](deploy/torhq.service) runs as the `torhq` user with
`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `PrivateTmp`, and a tight
`ReadWritePaths` list. **`ReadWritePaths` must include every media path you want
intake to write to** — keep it consistent with `TORHQ_APPROVED_ROOTS`.

### Upgrades

```bash
/srv/torhq/app/scripts/upgrade.sh   # backs up, pulls, npm ci, build, migrate, restart
```

Migrations are forward-only and idempotent, so re-running an upgrade is safe.

---

## Backup & restore

State worth backing up is small: the SQLite database and the env file (which
holds `TORHQ_MASTER_KEY`). **Media libraries are not backed up by TorHQ.**

```bash
# Back up (WAL-safe online .backup + the env file), default dest /srv/torhq/backups
/srv/torhq/app/scripts/backup.sh
```

`scripts/backup.sh` produces `torhq-<timestamp>.tar.gz` containing a consistent
DB snapshot and a copy of `torhq.env`.

> **The master key is everything.** Encrypted service secrets are unreadable
> without the `TORHQ_MASTER_KEY` that was in effect when they were saved. Protect
> the backup accordingly, and never rotate the key without re-entering secrets.

**Restore:**

```bash
systemctl stop torhq
tar -xzf torhq-<timestamp>.tar.gz -C /tmp
install -o torhq -g torhq -m600 /tmp/torhq-<timestamp>.db  /srv/torhq/data/torhq.db
install -o torhq -g torhq -m640 /tmp/torhq-<timestamp>.env /etc/torhq/torhq.env
systemctl start torhq
```

---

## Security model

- **Secrets stay server-side.** Service credentials are encrypted at rest with
  AES-256-GCM (key derived from `TORHQ_MASTER_KEY` via scrypt). The API returns
  only a masked hint (`••••••••abcd`); full secrets are never sent to the browser
  or written to logs (pino redaction covers cookies, auth headers, and secret-ish keys).
- **Auth.** Single admin account, scrypt password hashing (N=32768), server-side
  sessions in a `Strict`, `HttpOnly` cookie with a 12-hour TTL and a constant-work
  path to blunt username-enumeration timing.
- **CSRF.** Double-submit token required on **every** state-changing request
  (including logout), via the `X-CSRF-Token` header matched against the session.
- **Rate limiting.** Global limiter plus a tighter limiter on auth and webhook routes.
- **Path containment.** Every filesystem path is validated against
  `TORHQ_APPROVED_ROOTS` with lexical traversal collapse, prefix-aliasing-safe
  prefix checks, and `realpath` symlink-escape rejection.
- **Webhook auth.** `/webhooks/slskd` requires a shared token compared in
  constant time.
- **Least privilege deployment.** Runs as an unprivileged user under a hardened
  systemd unit; binds to loopback by default.

## API

The server exposes an OpenAPI 3.1 document at `GET /api/openapi.json`, and a
`curl` walkthrough of every endpoint lives in
[`docs/curl-examples.md`](docs/curl-examples.md). All `/api/*` routes except the
auth endpoints require a session; all mutating routes additionally require the
CSRF header.
